# My website (on github domain yeah)
So far, there is only a stub page. But you can change the language, click buttons, and watch a very nice video by pressing the big button :)

I don't actually know if I'll add something interesting on my page or not.
I just wanted to learn some HTML, CSS, and JavaScript basics.
